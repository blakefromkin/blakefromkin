### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Blake.

I'm a full-stack software engineer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Go, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, and AWS.  I leverage the creative problem-solving skills I honed in my previous role as an Associate Creative Director to tackle complex engineering challenges and communicate effectively with my teammates.

Most recently, I built [Reverb](https://reverb-app.github.io/), an event-driven workflow engine that reliably orchestrates complex, multi-step background jobs.

I'm currently looking for my next role, so please get in touch if you think I'd be a good fit for your team.
